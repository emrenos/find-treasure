# Find the Treasure Game

Welcome to the Find the Treasure Game! This is a simple text-based game where you have to guess the location of the treasure hidden in a 3x3 grid.

## How to Play

1. The game will display a 3x3 grid, where each cell is represented by a `⬜️`.
2. The computer will randomly choose a cell to hide the treasure.
3. You will be prompted to enter your name.
4. You will then make a guess by entering the cell's coordinate (e.g., `A1`, `C3`).
5. If you guess correctly, you win! If not, you can try again.
